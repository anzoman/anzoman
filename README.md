### About me
I am full of energy and ready to accept any kind of challenge. I like being out of my comfort zone and always trying to explore new things. I am also passionate about tech, sports, traveling the world, and meeting new people. 

Most of my work experiences come from the field of computer science and software engineering (Backend, DevOps, FullStack). I also have some experience in management, marketing, entrepreneurship, and love making new ideas come true. As a DevOps engineer, I believe that automation and orchestration can make our lives happier. Some say that dribbling is my middle name, not just with the ball on a football pitch, but also to overcome all the bugs that I stumble upon on my way. As a Toolchain lead, I contribute to enabling trustable automation for [Steampunk Spotter](https://steampunk.si/spotter/) within [XLAB Steampunk](https://steampunk.si/) team.
