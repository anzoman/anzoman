### About me
I am full of energy and ready to accept any kind of challenge. I like being out of my comfort zone and always trying to explore new things. I am also passionate about tech, sports, traveling the world, and meeting new people. 

Most of my work experiences come from the field of computer science and software engineering, especially DevOps, cloud computing, and backend development. Also have some experience in management, marketing, entrepreneurship, and love making new ideas come true. As a DevOps engineer, I believe that automation and orchestration can make our lives happier. Some say that dribbling is my middle name, not just with the ball on a football pitch, but also to overcome all the bugs that I stumble upon on my way. As a Toolchain lead, I contribute to enabling trustable automation for [Steampunk Spotter](https://steampunk.si/spotter/) within [XLAB Steampunk](https://steampunk.si/) team.
