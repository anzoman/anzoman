### About me
I am full of energy and ready to accept any challenge. I like being out of my comfort zone and always trying to explore new things. I am also passionate about tech, sports, traveling the world, and meeting new people. 

Most of my work experiences come from the field of computer science and software engineering (Backend, DevOps, FullStack). I also have some experience in management, marketing, and entrepreneurship. I love making new ideas come true. I believe in the future of AI and Web3 and that automation and orchestration can make our lives happier. Some say that dribbling is my middle name, not just with the ball on a football pitch, but also to overcome all the bugs that I stumble upon.
